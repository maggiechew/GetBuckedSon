# GetBuckedSon
IU C9 Project 1

Welcome to my game! Your mission- should you choose to accept it- is to STAY ON YOUR DONKEY!

The Donkey will try to throw you off by veering either left or right;
by holding on and leaning into the turns, you will stay put!
Not holding on in time, or leaning the wrong way, will get you BUCKED OFF!

Tutorial available, in addition to user options such as creating/ logging into user accounts.
