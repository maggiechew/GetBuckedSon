# GetBuckedSon
IU C9 Project 1


Game: Stay in the saddle!! 
- User objective is to react in time to prompts in order to stay on their donkey 
- Donkey always follows the course, turning LEFT or RIGHT; user needs to lean RIGHT or LEFT to remain seated.

 

Donkey can:  

-Turn (rider has to lean out of turn, then stabilize) 


 

User can: 

-Lean l/r for stability (arrow or wasd?) 
-Lean f/b for speed (arrow or wasd?) 
-Hold on with left click 
-Kick with right click 
 

Difficulty updates donkey object; 

-Normal (irritable) (moderately high chance of buck. Regular distance.) 
// to do: -Lazy (chance of stop increases with speed, but never bucks. Shorter distance) 
// to do: -Berserker (only bucks; speed and key presses increases with each instance. Shorter distance) 



Blue Sky:
 
Donkey can:
-Buck (rider holds on! Number of key presses to pass/fail buck) 
-Faster (decreases user reaction time allowance/ decreased incidence of buck/ stop) 
-Slower (increases user reaction time/ increased incidence of buck/ stop) 
-Stop (donkey sees something to eat; force random 1-5 second break. Kick has a 50/50 chance of ending stop, or initiating buck. Will not stop again for min x number of seconds)
